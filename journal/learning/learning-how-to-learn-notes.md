# Module 1

> It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something **new**. Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics[^0] - Dr. Barbara Oakley
>
> - Topics which are visible real objects (like cows or trees) or are associated with emotions but still abstract (like love or hope) are easier to learn.
>
> And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping both improve our memory and our ability to learn. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

> - Also, an enriched environment (...) is very important.

### Focused & Diffuse Thinking

These are two essential learning modes of your brain.

Diffuse thinking is often active when resting. 

Focused thinking means that you're actively concentrating on something using rational, sequential, analytical approaches.

> So, the bottom line is, when you're learning something new, especially something that's a little more difficult, your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the two different learning modes. That's what helps you learn effectively. You might think of it as a bit analogous to building your strength by lifting weights. You would never plan to compete in a weightlifting competition by waiting until the very day before a meet and then spending the entire day working out like a fiend. I mean, it just doesn't happen that way. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

~~**Analogy**: Think of a ping-pong table and a ball jumping back and forth on each side when switching between the modes.~~

**Analogy**: *Activating a thought process* when learning is like a Pinball machine working in your head. Imagine rows of bumpers layed out as a 2-D grid over your brain. When the pinball machine releases the ball it finds a pattern between mutliple bumbers. 

>  You think a thought, boom, it takes off, moves smoothly along. And then, as it's bouncing around on the bumpers, you're able to figure out the problem you're trying to solve, or, the concept you're trying to understand that's related to something you're rather familiar with. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

**Analogy:** *Focused Thinking* is like a Pinball machine with a lot of very close bumpers. It activates a very clear and close pattern. **It is like looking at the small parts of a problem**.

**Analogy:** *Diffuse Thinking* is like a Pinball machine with few very widely spaced bumpers. It is used to reach areas in the brain which would not be accessible by focused thinking (Think of the very close bumpers blocking the way). It helps to grasp new concepts which you never thought of before, or helps when the problem you are working on needs new ideas or approaches. **It is like looking at the big picture of a problem.**

- **It seems you can't be in both thinking modes at the same time**.

> It's kind of like a coin. We can see either one side, or the other side of the coin. But not both sides at the same time. Being in one mode seems to limit your access to the other mode's way of thinking. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

- Learning too much without breaks and sleep in between, cramming it all inside leads to a weak neuronal foundation. **Analogy**: Think of the neural patterns in your brain is like building a brick wall. You need breaks and sleep so that connections can get strong and the bricks doesn't fall appart. **So let the mortar dry!**

> When you're learning, what you want to do is study something. Study it hard by focusing intently. Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for awhile. During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. Your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry. If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming, your knowledge base will look more like this (picture shown), all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

##### Core Ideas

- Metaphor and analogy are really helpful when you're trying to learn something new.
- The brain's two different learning modes focused and diffuse helps us learn but in very different ways.
- Learning something difficult can take time:

> Your brain needs to alternate it's ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material - Dr. Barbara Oakley

**Ask yourself**:

When do you find your mind relaxing somewhat and getting away from focused attention? 
When taking a shower? Riding on the bus? Going for a walk?

- When being in nature, or on the balcony. 
- Silence is a good addition. 
- Rainy days at home.
- Going for a long walk especially on a beautiful spring day or rainy autumn day. 
- When smoking cigarettes.
- When laying in bed and resting.
- Breathing cold air in.

### Procrastination[^1]

> When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared. So it seems what happens when you procrastinate, is something like this. First, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease.You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier, temporarily. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

A handy little mental tool: The **Pomodoro**[^2] method 

- How it works: 25 min focusing on something, without disruptions and then **reward**[^3] yourself.

> This helps you get going, using brief periods each day of focused attention, that will help you start building the neural patterns you need to be more successful in learning more challenging materials. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

**Ask yourself**:

What in particular would YOU want to make sure is turned off or unavailable to ensure
you retain your focus when you do a Pomodoro ?

Unavailable/Off:

- Smartphone

...

Improving Focus:

- Silence
- Know boundaries of my task
- Clean working environement
- Nice environment, plants, light
- Hardware timer
- Posture and current working location (bed..)
- **Enough hydration**
- **If I work on a pc, a nice feeling keyboard**
- **Task vs. Reward** (Overthinking reward - not starting)
- **Body and Mood feeling (tired, lazy etc.)**

### Chunking, Memory & Repetition

> Practice makes permanent !

Working Memory and Long Term Memory are the major systems for learning and making permanent memory of our brain [^4]. When you are learning something new, you use your prefrontal cortex and your Working Memory. Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind.

#### Working Memory

It is widely believed, that your working memory can hold only 4 chunks[^5] of information at the same time.

You often need to keep repeating what you're trying to work with so it stays in your working memory.

> Repetitions needed so that your metabolic vampires that is natural dissipating processes don't suck those memories away.   - Dr. Barbara Oakley

**Analogy**: Short-term memory is something like an **inefficient mental blackboard** where the letters fade away in a short period of time.

#### Long Term Memory

**Analogy**: Long term memory is a wide storage warehouse, and just like a warehouse, it's distributed over a big area[^6]. 

> The long-term memory storage warehouse is immense, it's got room for billions of items. In fact there can be so many items they can bury each other. So it can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about. When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long-term memory, it often takes time and practice. To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, but what you want to do is space this repetition out. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

##### Spaced Repetition

- It will help you to retain information in your Long term memory effectively. Instead of cramming, you space out your learning sessions over mutiple days, with breaks in between.

### The importance of Sleep in Learning

- Just being awake produces toxin products in your brain.
- Sleeping is important so that the brain can get rid of the toxins. These toxins can make it so you can't think very clearly if you don't sleep enough.

> How does the brain get rid of these poisons? Turns out that when you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells. It's like unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So, sleep which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time is actually your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy - Dr. Barbara Oakley

- **Sleeping is actually an important part of the memory and learning process.**
  - It strengthens important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories.
  - allows your brain a chance to rehearse difficult material--going over and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learn.
  - makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you are trying to learn.

> It seems that during sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember.
>
> During sleep, your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.
>
> Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the prefrontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping. *Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work.* - Dr. Barbara Oakley

**Analogy**:

(...)

- Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand.

  **Increase chances of dreaming:**

  - Go over what you are learning right before taking a nap or going to sleep.
  - Set in mind that you *want* to dream about the material.

### Note-taking tools and tips[^8]

- *Avoid transcribing* notes (writing every word the instructor says) in favor of writing notes in your own words.
- *Review your notes* the same day you created them and then on a regular basis, rather than cramming review into one long study session immediately prior to an exam.
- *Test yourself* on the content of your notes either by using flashcards or using methodology from [Cornell Notes](http://coe.jmu.edu/learningtoolbox/cornellnotes.html). Testing yourself helps you identify what you do not yet know from your notes, and successful recall of tested information improves your ability to recall that information later (you will be less likely to forget it).
- Carefully consider whether to take notes on pen and paper or with a laptop. There are costs and benefits to either option.
- We are often misled to believe that we know lecture content better than we actually do, which can lead to poor study decisions. **Avoid this misperception at all costs**!

### Side Notes

It is possible to change and become accomplished in areas that you don't think you can do very well at.

Analytical and metaphorical approaches...

Practice makes permanent memory.

When Barb gets up in the morning, she looks over her **Day** list, and then sets out a little mini-list of three or four mini-tasks on a small **Now** list on a different part of the same page as the **Day** list. Using her wonderful pencil, she gets to cross off each of those smaller tasks as she does them. It feels great! As she gradually finishes the items on the bigger **Day** list, she crosses them off there, too. She usually don’t finish all the items on the **Day** list, but she makes a lot of progress this way. Barb usually tries to get at least one Pomodoro in early on her toughest task, to “eat her frogs first.”

### Chunks & Chunking



#### What is a Chunk ?

> As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

*A  chunk is a network of neurons that are used to fire together when a familiar action or thought is provoked, to help you think or perform smoothly and effectively.*

> Chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, through bound together through meaning or use.  - Dr. Barbara Oakley

Examples: Dressing yourself, rolling a cigarette, going to toilet, walking, drinking, eating, dish washing, beard shaving, swimming, music, dance, doing simple math like adding numbers, spoken words -- also ideas and concepts, simply put, anything where humans can good at -- These thoughts are the basis of much of the science, literature and art.

> Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning. The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you're learning. 
>
> Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning. 
>
> **Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't know need to remember all the little underlying details. You've got the main idea, the chunk, <u>and that's enough</u>.** - Dr. Barbara Oakley



Also, chunks get larger over time and can connect together to build a **group of chunks**. Is that true ? (...)

- **Question & Reflection: Does these groups count as "one chunk" for the working memory ?** I think this is the case. I think these groups of chunks must be forming multiple interconnected long term memories which are related to one another, in order to manage complex interactions by thought and actions in the future.

- **Question & Reflection: Are chunks always stored in the Long Term Memory?** - If I understand the material correctly, this must be the case, because chunks are formed and reused later on in life through the prefrontal cortex, which does by itself not have a long term memory[^9]. The counterpart, the Working Memory[^10], relies on the LTM because by itself, it can't hold any memory long term. If any chunks would not live in the LTM, wouldn't that mean they could not be persistant ?

  **Analogy**: Chunks are like packages stored in the [wide storage warehouse](#Long Term Memory) analogy.



**Remember**: Only four chunks can be handled by your WM at the same time.

**Analogy**: Imagine your working memory is an Octupus. There are four wholes beneath it. It has four arms and can access and hold four chunks through the holes at the same time. This happens, when you focus on something.

> Remember, this is different from the random connections of the diffuse mode. Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. 
>
> It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk. Interestingly when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid. - Dr. Barbara Oakley



#### How to Form a Chunk.

- To learn a new complex topic, it helps to analyse, grasp and master small steps to build 'micro chunks'. These micro chunks, can connect together to build lager chunks and thus lead to better understanding. Also, it is not too important of why individual steps work by theirself, but how they connect and build upon each other and why a next step is the next thing to do.

**Analogy**: When learning to play a song on guitar, at first it helps to learn small single patterns or bits which occur in the song. Later on you will learn to connect them together, to play the whole song. It is like using a map to help find an unkown place. Soon you will find the way on your own. You will even find new ways to get there.

> In learning a sport, say basketball, soccer, golf, you grasp and master various bits and pieces of the skills you need. You're creating little neural mini chunks that you can then gradually knit together into larger neural chunks. 
>
> Later, you can knit those larger chunks into still larger and more complex chunks that you can draw up in an instant in reaction say to a slight shift and twist in the soccer ball that's coming your way. The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together. - Dr. Barbara Oakley

Looking at worked out solutions beforehand, helps to see the key features and underlying principles of a problem.



- How you can use them to improve your understanding of, and creativity with the material, and how chunks can help you do better on tests.
  - Less effective methods
  - Better methods

- Illusions of competence in learning
- Overlearning
  - Interleaving
