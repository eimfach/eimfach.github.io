              Hello, my name is Robin Gruenke, born in Germany.
              I am a Computer Science Expert, developing Software since 2009,
              with the main background on web application development.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="read-width-optimized auto">
              In my past experiences, I got in touch with manifold and
              interesting projects where I was able to work deeply with people and
              technologies. Sharing thoughts with people about Technologies and
              integrating complex stuff to be seamless and easy to use, is something
              I am really passionate about.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="read-width-optimized auto">
              Not only that I love to improve stuff and create maintainable architectures,
              I also love to design UI Elements and think about the best user experiences
              involved. For me, the most important thing in creating projects
              is that to have quality and the right foundation. You could compare
              it to building a house: If your material is low in quality or the
              foundation is weak, how long is the house supposed to stay ?<br><br>

                While working for Airberlin on their new booking web application, I implemented a complex
                feature for messaging the user visually as a feedback to their actions. In the cycle of the
                Single Page Application and the users asynchronous requests the messaging had to be reliable
                in terms of removing order, timing and animation when the requests were resolved.
                I implemented a Service which heavily relied on Promises and Request Queueing,
                while utilizing a factory pattern to create a messaging system which could be configurated
                by implementation (

                Resolving a legacy issue regarding file upload,
                I enhanced a promise enabled API solution to enable direct file uploads via
                Amazon Web Services. The difficulty was to simplify a new highly flexible and secure upload situation
                with three endpoints, which the frontend had to interact with.
                The implementation acted as a simple interface which was able to tell the upload progress
                and replay the needed requests if an error occured.
                That means you could use it without the need to know what actually happens in the background,
                or providing dependent data from former request to another.
                I used ESNext Async & Await to ensure a flat code complexity footprint.
